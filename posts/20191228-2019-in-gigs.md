Live music is one of my favorite experiences. One thing that has taken me a while to realize is that most people, even if they say otherwise, don't actually like it. It generally goes very late, it's impossible (or at least rude) to have a conversation with the people you came with, there's often a lot of unnecessary standing in lines... 

But to me, all of that disappears the minute the music starts. There's something magical about watching good musicians do what they do, and the (false, but no less enjoyable) feeling of cameraderie and community that develops between everyone present. I was lucky to see a number of great shows this year, and wanted to mention them here.

## [April 11 - Switchfoot][sf1]

I'd last seen these guys [in 2016][sf], and that show was not especially memorable, as I happened to find myself surrounded by so many tall people that I never once saw the band or the stage. This time, it was a general admission gig, and getting in line by 5pm gave me a great view of everything. Given I didn't exactly "see" the last tour, I was glad they retained a couple of the production elements for the songs from the previous album (the bubbles/mirrorball thing in Float, for instance). I didn't realize it at the time, but the Neptune in Seattle is about 1/4th the size of the rest of the venues they played on this tour, and as a result they didn't bring the video screens which are usually had behind the band - this made for an intimate, raucous gig. 

They opened with what is probably [my least favorite song of theirs][ts], but then tore into about half of their new album and a survey of the best tracks of the last 10 years or so, mostly centered around their most recent 3 records. I continue to be impressed by the way they keep pushing their live repetoire forward rather than relying on the same collection of hits. As a setlist nerd, though, I was a little disappointed that they made a big song and dance about a song they'd decided to play 'especially for tonight' only to play one which they've played in exactly that same spot through the whole tour. I remember Bono talking years ago about the problem that "the audience has last night's setlist", and while I agree that the past was easier in that respect, it's probably better to admit that we're in the present. 

The section in the middle of the show where they sing with an acoustic guitar around one microphone makes for a fun moment, but introducing it as "taking things back to where it all started" seems a little out of place, these guys had loud electric guitars from their first gig.

Switchfoot gigs probably best encapsulate the cameraderie aspect I was talking about earlier - the nigth is a big communnal singalong, and this one was no different.

## [April 13 - Switchfoot][sf2]

They were playing in Canada a couple of nights later, and I'd never been north of the border, so decided this was a good excuse. Vancouver as a city is very cool, I'd like to explore it more someday. This was more representative of the rest of the tour, I think, in a pretty large theatre, with big lights and big screens. The gig was great, and it being the last night of the tour had everyone in a playful mood, with a toilet paper fight on stage at the end of the night. 

[Tyson Motsenbocker][tm] has opened several shows of theirs I've seen by now, and his "Isn't the American church awful" schtick doesn't really do anything for me. I don't like much of American evangelical culture either, but that culture is the _only_ reason you have any sort of music career, Tyson. Without running in the sort of circles where your music is seen as "safe" to the parents of churchy teenagers, you'd be trying unsuccessfully to get a slot at a coffee house open mic. So maybe find some more constructive way to channel your angst about it.

## [July 12 - Queen plus Adam Lambert][q]

Queen were the first band I remember specifically liking as a kid. I'm sure there are several origins of this, but the one I remember specifically was being in some school play or other where the Flash Gordon theme was used. I was sure I'd heard the song before somewhere and rifled through my parents' cds until finding Queen's [first Greatest Hits album][gh], to this day the biggest selling album in the UK.
