            <time datetime="2015-09-26 17:46:00" pubdate="pubdate">September 26th 2015</time></p><p>My apartment is disappointing. I know this, because everyone who has ever been inside has remarked on one of its less savory elements, like the fact that I don't own any tables. Or curtains. Or the fact that the windows don't open. Or the leak in the ceiling.</p>
<p>This was all news to me - I have remarkably little awareness of the parts of the world around me unrelated to the task at hand, which is why my shoes are always untied and I have to rely on external feedback about my breath. But now others have pointed out that my home is unlikely to attract someone to spend their life with its tenant, I have been moved from disinterest to incessant complaining. How lucky for my friends.</p>
<p>Whenever I start ranting about this, someone will inevitably say &quot;why don't you just move, then?&quot; This is a completely reasonable question, and I don't have a good answer. Similarly, if you've been around me for any length of time, you've either witnessed me drink too much and talk/text unending nonsense, or you've heard me be frustrated by my tendency to do so, and an inevitable question of the same kind arises - &quot;why don't you just stop, then?&quot;</p>
<p>Regardless of the inventiveness of my response, the truth is that if I'm not willing to take any of the more direct steps to fix those problems, then there are some things I consider worth more than their resolution. This isn't wrong in itself - very few things are ultimate. I consider the lack of men's 29&quot; length jeans available for sale FREAKING ANYWHERE to be a significant problem, for example, but I wouldn't want to pass a law requiring stores to stock them. In so doing, it becomes clear that for all my whining, I value certain things about a free market more than I value the convenience of being able to purchase clothes that fit.</p>
<p>This self-awareness of the way we communicate our values is missed from the public sphere sometimes, I think. One common economic conversation goes like this:</p>
<p><strong>Person A</strong>: &quot;Corporations are amoral, so we need to obligate them to contribute to the country and pay workers fairly through taxes and wage requirements.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Person B</strong>: &quot;But we can't do very much of that, because they'll just go to another state/country, and then what would we do?&quot;</p>
<p>Person B would likely not say they think corporations rather than governments are the final authority in the world, anymore than I would suggest I enjoy beer more than I hate the consequences of drinking too much of it, but the options we consider &quot;off the table&quot; communicate more about what's really going on in our heads and hearts than the words we say.</p>
<p>When nine people were shot in Charleston ten days ago, the first reaction of several was to say &quot;we must not use this moment to talk about gun control.&quot; Franklin Graham said the problem was not guns, but Hollywood's corrupting influence. Rick Perry said the problem was not guns, but drugs. Facebook was full of well thought out political discourse, such as memes which said &quot;no one blames the car in a car crash&quot; and &quot;Cain killed Abel with a rock.&quot; Would changes in gun laws have made a difference in this instance? I don't know the facts or the potential solutions well enough. But when a person's first/loudest response to a shooting is to protect their right to keep and arm bears, it communicates more than just opposition to gun control. It shows the things they consider less important than maintaining the current levels of access to guns.</p>
